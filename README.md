# iTechnoLabs-ReactNative
Work on prof of concept to support the software idea.   


# Right now we are writing code to display the ability in React Native to support speech to text.   


Here are the notes in Lucid Chart

https://lucid.app/lucidchart/f61ad56b-6e56-4c06-9973-d254ef31f49c/edit?beaconFlowId=FD6ACAF94A0D6BB6&invitationId=inv_d6868e24-027a-49c7-b1b4-d0fca97542ac&page=S9ddr8W6IaOA#

**Note - please save a baseline react native project in the GitHub repository before checking in any code that has references to speech to text.   I want to be able to easily see what references were adeed to a base React Native application(such as a simple hello world React Native application) to support Speech to Text.  

Keep in mind that I'm trying to resolve what I would consider the technical challenges that we will need to overcome using React Native.   Once I see these challenges are met we will move forward. 




This example will be the proff of concept that the speech to text can be achieved.  I want an application to be running that willl listen to spoken words(similarly to what a tex box speech to text does now) and as it hears the spoken work, the React Native app will translate the words and when the app hears the words "red", "Blue", "Yellow" or "Light Blue"  the "Color Button" at the top of the page changes to the appropriate color(Indicated in mock screen shot). 



Requirement: 
-- Must be as real time as possible(within a second maybe two seconds)
--React Native Code must work on both IOS(iphone) and Android - the most current version as possible
--

Security
mock an authenticated OpenId Connect User with the appropriate json representation for the user security model. (we will be doing the login screen later)



What I will be doing.
I will be learning React Native to parrellel our efforts.
